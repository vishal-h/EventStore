NEventStore
======================================================================

NEventStore is a persistence library used to abstract different storage implementations
when using event sourcing as storage mechanism. This library is developed with a specific focus on [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)/[CQRS](http://cqrsinfo.com) applications.

Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/NEventStore/NEventStore/wiki) to get started and for more information.
